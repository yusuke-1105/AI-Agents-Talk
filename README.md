# 🔎 AI Agents Talk

This application is a Streamlit app where two generative AIs with predefined personalities answer questions in a dialogue format.  
It's an application where two agents discuss and reach a final conclusion in response to questions entered by the user.

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Docker Desktop (with Docker and Docker Compose) installed.  
  Install from [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).
- An Anthropic API key obtained from the [Anthropic website](https://www.anthropic.com/api).

## 🐳 Running with Docker

```

### Set up environment variables

Copy `example.env` to `.env` and set your API key:

```bash
cp example.env .env
# Edit .env and replace ANTHROPIC_API_KEY with your key:
